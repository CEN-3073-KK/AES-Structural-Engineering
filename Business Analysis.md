# 1. Introduction
## Business purpose
The Jacksonville branch for Atlantic Engineering Services needs more employees to take on more projects and to better divide up the work load. The issue is that there is a low amount of job applicants for the company to pick from. The company website does not entice or attract any prospective employees because of a lack of detail and content in the career page and about the branches of the company. The proposed system will improve the content and presentation of the career page and about the branches of the company.

## Business scope
The business domain that Atlantic Engineering Services is considered as is a structural engineering firm. The company inspects buildings for to see if the structural code it up to date and to see if there is no damage or violation, they restore buldings, climb buildings, and structurally design them as well as inspect process. What part of their business is being changed is how they represent themselves to customers and potential employees which affect their work load, manpower, and their reputation up-front. This would also affect the work load of human resources and the ITS team.

## Overview
The major internal division are the two branches, the main branch is in Pittsburg, then other branch is in Jacksonville, FL and an empty open store front in Morgantown, WV. The Pittsburg and Jacksonville branch work with each other on projects while working on projects individually. The areas that each branch operates are different because of the locations and the empty open store front exists to do projects in that area. 

The external entities involved are the in-state clients, clients that are out of state, the network and computer security firm that secures their data, the architects and other engineers, contractors, and business representatives.

The ITS will be responsible for implementing the final product and archiving the legacy design and forms. The product will be verified by the company executive leadership or by a senior employee of the company. 

## Preliminary deployment concept

## Preliminary support concept
The support that is necessary for the product after release would be from the ITS and human resources teams to maintain, preserve, and run the webpage. The ITS would be providing maintenance by maintaining the webpages and website by maintaining the server running the webpage and updating the content and items. ITS would also be training human resources to use the new system. Human resources will be operating the page, receiving emails, and calls from the system by the users. 

## Preliminary retirement concept
To retire the system is to either update to a better system or completely change the system altogether. When being retired, the designs would be archived and logged as design assets. The systems will redirect to the updated or new webpage.
