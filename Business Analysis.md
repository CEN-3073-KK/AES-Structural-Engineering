# 1. Introduction
## Business purpose
The Jacksonville branch for Atlantic Engineering Services needs more employees to take on more projects and to better divide up the work load. The issue is that there is a low amount of job applicants for the company to pick from. The company website does not entice or attract any prospective employees because of a lack of detail and content in the career page and about the branches of the company. The proposed system will improve the content and presentation of the career page and about the branches of the company.

## Business scope
The business domain that Atlantic Engineering Services is considered as is a structural engineering firm. The company inspects buildings for to see if the structural code it up to date and to see if there is no damage or violation, they restore buldings, climb buildings, and structurally design them as well as inspect process. What part of their business is being changed is how they represent themselves to customers and potential employees which affect their work load, manpower, and their reputation up-front. This would also affect the work load of human resources and the ITS team.

# 3. Business management requirements
## Business environment

i.	External environmental factors include growth initiatives and financial stability of owners and business entities who have significant property that exist within our built environment. These companies are most notably within the healthcare, higher educational, and commercial real estate industries. Directly in relation to AES, many times our business comes directly from architecture and other A/E/C firms that need structural support for their projects. These project invitations are also directly related to the external environmental factors created by the owners and businesses who need architectural support for new or existing facilities. Changes to our website and online presence should be targeted to communicate our experience and proficiency within these industries and client groups. 

ii.	Internal environmental factors include, but are not limited to current firm workload, the capacity and capabilities of our professional engineers, state licensure, office locations, employee health/status, desire for hiring new employees.

## Mission, goals, and objectives
i.	Specifically regarding the proposed system of adding new capabilities to drive job applicants, results will be to drive new applicants for potential hiring positions at AES, for both the Pittsburgh and Jacksonville locations. Applicant information should be obtained to respond appropriately to them. A goal of three applicants each month will be set through organic inbound methods, while higher standards may be set when hiring campaigns are underway and other methods are being paired with the website.
## Business model
i.	Improvements to the website to drive job applicants should closely adhere to the purpose of our firm, which is to provide structural engineering services. Attracting applicants specifically within the Western Pennsylvania and Northern Florida regions is ideal, focused on the city regions of Pittsburgh and Jacksonville, respectively. However, applicants from other regions will not be turned away, though they will be expected to relocated to our office locations.

ii.	Hiring information, especially when there is a hiring campaign underway, will also be communicated through LinkedIn, and also dispersed through potential hiring consultants such as headhunters, etc.

## Information environment

# 4. Business operational requirements
## Business processes
a.	System interfaces should communicate what is present in our hiring brochures (benefits, etc.) in an ergonomic and attractive manner to potential applicants.

b.	Company culture should be transparently shown as well to attract desired applicants.

## Business operational policies and rules
a.	AES has a Marketing Manual, a nearly-completed Employee Manual, but no Policies and Procedures manual.

b.	In this case, deciding logical propositions for the business processes should be coordinated through the Marketing Director at AES regarding any updates to the website.

## Business operational constraints
a.	Conditions to be imposed are filtering and recording new applicants in real time, storing their answers in a secure software platform, work in coordination with the existing system processes and structure, and every occurrence of the process should be monitored and recorded by the Marketing Department.

## Business operational modes
a.	The business operation should be able to proceed independently and securely. The product should allow our staff to check in periodically for responses. The page should be able to receive any amount of applicants at any given time, and support significant traffic.

## Business operational quality
a.	The business operation should have a high quality in appearance and design, and be ergonomic to the user. Putting the process in place has a fairly high urgency.

## Business structure
a.	The structures relevant can be found for both Positions and Locations on https://www.aespj.com/careers, and the structure for the application form, which is also available on the same page.

The ITS will be responsible for implementing the final product and archiving the legacy design and forms. The product will be verified by the company executive leadership or by a senior employee of the company. 

## Preliminary deployment concept

## Preliminary support concept
The support that is necessary for the product after release would be from the ITS and human resources teams to maintain, preserve, and run the webpage. The ITS would be providing maintenance by maintaining the webpages and website by maintaining the server running the webpage and updating the content and items. ITS would also be training human resources to use the new system. Human resources will be operating the page, receiving emails, and calls from the system by the users. 

## Preliminary retirement concept
To retire the system is to either update to a better system or completely change the system altogether. When being retired, the designs would be archived and logged as design assets. The systems will redirect their links to the updated or new webpages.
