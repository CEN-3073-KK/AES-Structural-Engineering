# Problem Statement
The Jacksonville branch of AES Structural Engineers suffers from a lack of job applicants due to lack of awareness or knowledge of the company and their location. To increase job applicants, we need to spread awareness of the company and their branches. To spread awareness, we need to elicit interest in the company via explicitly showing job listings and possible pay and benifits, giving the branches of the company more detail and recognition, and showing the interesting projects and products. For this to happen, the company website must be upgraded. 


# Assumptions
Improving website will increase job applications from prospect employees.

A detailed plan is needed for the ITS team.

Elicitation and feedback are needed.

The target demographic are prospective employees who are civil or structural engineers, or people with the skill to draft and design.

The target demographic for people with those qualities are recent college graduates and people in the industry wishing to find a better job.

Improving the website will give other company branches more recognition.
